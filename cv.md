## About me
I have an experience of participating in the VR-projects development as a Level Designer, therefore I am familiar with the field of software development. Unfortunately, I have no direct experience in programming, though I have some experience in game development using visual programming languages (Blueprints).  
I've been interested in front-end recently. I am interested in this topic, and I would like to develop my skills in it and achieve good results. I plan to master the back-end as well in future, in order to be able to implement web applications in full cycle.
I am engaged in self-development, currently studying at RSShool, where I expect to get practical experience in front-end.
